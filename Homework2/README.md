Coding Problem 2
  This problem requires code that is able to read a given date and translate it to a parsed form.
  
    Part A
      This version of the code takes the given line and determines if the given date has the correct requiremtns to be
      displayed in the output: must not occur after the current date, have this format "December 12, 2016", and must be 
      outputted as "12/12/2016".
      
    Part B
      This version of the code modifies the program so that the dates are read from an text file called, "inputDates.txt".
      
    Part C
      This version of the code modifies the program so that the outputted dates are written onto a different text file
      called "parsedDates.txt".
